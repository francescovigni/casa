This roadmap is designed to take you from "PhD Student" to "Senior Robotics Engineer" in 4 phases. The goal is to make your site do the heavy lifting for you—convincing recruiters you are industry-ready before they even speak to you.

Phase 1: The "Immediate Pivot" (Effort: 2-3 Hours)Goal: Stop the "academic signal" immediately.Rewrite the Hero HeadlineCurrent: "Freelance Machine Learning Engineer..."Change to: "Robotics & AI Engineer (Ph.D.) | Transforming Research into Reliable Autonomous Systems."Sub-text: "Specializing in Human-Robot Interaction, Perception, and Production-Grade ML Deployments."Sanitize the "News" SectionRename: Change "News" to "Engineering Log" or "Milestones".Filter: Delete "Paper accepted" updates. Keep only:"Won Startup Creation Lab Prize (Dec 2025)""Achieved Professional Engineering License (Mar 2025)""Deployed v1 of [Project Name]"The "3-Second Rule" CVUpload the new "Industry" resume we discussed (the one focusing on "9% reliability increase" and "MVP creation").Change the download button text from "CV" to "Download Industry Resume".

Phase 2: Content Re-Packaging (Effort: 1 Day)Goal: Speak the language of ROI and Engineering, not Theory.Project Renaming StrategyGo through your "Projects" list and rename them to sound like Products.SISM Thesis Work $\rightarrow$ "Autonomous Interaction Engine: State Machine for Dynamic Crowds"Roboception Work $\rightarrow$ "Industrial Vision: 9% Reliability Uplift in Bin-Picking"Rosbag Tool $\rightarrow$ "Data Ops: Automated Dataset Validation Pipeline"The "Tech Stack" Badge SystemUnder every project title, add visible badges for the stack used. Do not hide this in the text.Example: [ROS2] [C++] [Docker] [PyTorch]The "Services" Section (For Freelancing)Add a dedicated section called "How I Can Help":R&D Acceleration: "I build the MVP while your team focuses on the core product."System Architecture: "Auditing ROS nodes and ML pipelines for latency and scalability."Mentorship: "Up-skilling junior teams in modern Robotics DevOps."

Phase 3: Visual & "Proof of Work" (Effort: 2-3 Days)Goal: Show, don't just tell.The Hero VideoReplace the static background or image with a muted, autoplaying video loop.Content: A montage of the Tiago robot moving, a simulation running, and a screen capture of code scrolling/executing.Interactive "Apps" Subdomain (apps.francescovigni.com)Deploy App 1 (Data Tool): A simple UI where a user uploads a JSON log and gets a "Health Score."Deploy App 2 (Vision Demo): A live YOLO/MediaPipe webcam demo.Link it: Add a button in your main nav bar called "Live Demos".Architecture DiagramsFor your top 2 projects, draw a simple block diagram (Sensors $\rightarrow$ Perception Node $\rightarrow$ Decision Logic $\rightarrow$ Actuation). This proves you understand System Integration.

Phase 4: The "Inbound Engine" (Ongoing)Goal: Make it easy for them to hire you.Call to Action (CTA)Replace hello@francescovigni.com with a button: "Book a 15-min Technical Discovery". Link this to a Calendly.The "Problem/Solution" Blog PostWrite one new blog post titled: "Why most Academic Robotics Code fails in Production (and how to fix it)."Discuss Docker, CI/CD, and Error Handling. This positions you as the expert who fixes the exact problem hiring managers are afraid of.
